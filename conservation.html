                    <h3>A Conservation Program for the Peyote Cactus (Lophophora williamsii)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Several compounding factors are simultaneously increasing pressure on the already limited
                        existing peyote populations in southern Texas. The most critical factor endangering the species
                        has been land development and subsequent habitat loss as rapid conversion of Chihuahuan Desert
                        for livestock production, agriculture, and commercial and residential development takes place.
                        This diminishing of desert habitat has in turn negatively impacted the likelihood that the
                        authorized commercial harvesting of peyote for Native American Church religious ceremonies can
                        continue without an extinction crisis developing within the next decade. The goal of this
                        article is to briefly address the factors involved in this conservation crisis and the potential
                        methods for alleviating it.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Habitat loss and the destruction of "thornbrush corridors" has become a major challenge for
                        numerous plant and animal species.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Viewed from above the South Texas landscape resembles a quilt patchwork of alternating
                        thornscrub parcels and "cleared" land. Areas cleared of Acacia and Mesquite species are largely
                        incapable of regenerating cacti and other plant seedlings which require the sheltering "nurse
                        plant" effect of which these native trees function. The result of this large scale clearing is
                        to, in effect, to create islands of original desert flora seperated by large areas favoring the
                        growth of oportunistic pioneer species. The effect is similar to the clear-cutting of an old
                        growth forest which might take several generations to reestablish itself into a version of its
                        original makeup and species diversity.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        The peyote cactus is particularly sensitive to the loss of suitable habitat, as it can easily
                        take 10 to 20 years to grow from a seedling to mature, harvestable size, which would also be
                        capable of seeding the next generation of plants.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        A cactus species which is very similar to peyote in appearance and habitat requirements, the
                        Star Cactus, (Astrophytum asterias), is federally listed as an endangered species and its
                        disturbance and commercial trade is severely restricted. In contrast the commercial trade of
                        peyote is regulated by federal and state controlled substances regulations and is legally
                        harvested from threatened areas in large quantities, with no plan for the continuation of the
                        species. Texas Department of Public Safety records indicate sales ranging from nearly one
                        million to upwards of, or more than two million plants annually. Due to a lack of "best
                        practices" harvesting methods, these harvested plants likely did not produce sufficient progeny
                        to maintain populations on the land from which they were culled.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Establishing a protocol for sustainable harvesting of the limited peyote populations which still
                        exist is a necessary measure with an extremely urgent timeline.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Education outreach and conservation advocacy with private landowners is one means of furthering
                        the effort to preserve natural populations, but is limited in practicality due to a lack of
                        cultural and economic incentive for the land owner. In addition, promoting the modification of
                        methods used by licensed peyote harvesters (to promote the "cherry-picking" of sufficiently
                        mature peyote plants) is an important aspect of any sustainable harvest program. However, as in
                        the case of the private landowner, without an economic incentive, licensed peyote harvesters are
                        left to their own prerogatives in deciding whether or not income producing specimens are left to
                        grow and continue their natural reproduction cycle.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        The need for non-governmental conservatory organizations to implement broad protective measures
                        and programs for endangered habitat in South Texas is also a necessary aspect of the larger
                        conservation issues affecting various threatened and endangered species endemic to the Chihuahan
                        Desert of South Texas.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        It is a growing consensus among members and officials of The Native American Church and other
                        religious organizations, licensed peyote dealers, and conservation scientists and researchers
                        that a crisis point has been reached both in terms of the amount of peyote currently available
                        and the lack of prospect for future harvestable populations. Without a focused purpose in
                        conserving the peyote which still exists, there is no forseeable source of future supply for the
                        next generation of worshippers who rely on the procurement of their sacrament from the Texas
                        peyoteros. It is not an overly dramatic statement to suggest that compounding economic,
                        regulatory, and environmental factors are potentially extinguishing not just a plant species,
                        but a spiritual tradition which has itself been upheld by numerous courts and acts of congress.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        With limited political clout and strict rules regarding the use, possession, purchase, and
                        cultivation of peyote, the people who hold this plant in high regard have had limited means of
                        safeguarding the future of their medicine. It is for this purpose that Morning Star Conservancy
                        was established. MSC addresses the need for non-political, multi-cultural, and
                        non-denominational advocacy for the unique and often misunderstood peyote cactus. With respect
                        for many past generations who maintained a sacred relationship with this plant, our goal is to
                        protect it for future generations to come.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        The mission of MSC is to educate and conserve. The production of a documentary film has been
                        initiated and will serve as an informational guide to the status of the species and the need for
                        further research, conservation, and potential regulatory amendments, which would promote the
                        preservation of the species.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Thanks to the ongoing research of several organizations and individuals such as The Cactus
                        Conservation Institute of Alpine, TX, we have a certain amount of knowledge from which the
                        specific sustainable harvest practices can begin to be developed and implemented. None of this
                        can be feasibly accomplished without the appropriate dedicated land base.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Therefore at this critical historical juncture, we invite you to support to this important
                        project.

                    <p>The Peyote Gardens is the affectionate name given to the only native habitat for Lophophora williamsii (Peyote) within the the United States of America. Peyote is unique in that it is only native to a single region within our entire planet. From the tip of San Luis Potosi, Mexico through to the southern region of Texas. </p>
